# palindrome
Program checks if a word, phrase or number is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same
backward as forward, such as madam or “taco cat” or racecar. Sentence-length palindromes may
be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word
dividers, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" or "No 'x' in
Nixon".
